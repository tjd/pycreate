We would like the following for the [Create](http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=305) robot:

  * A simple, but graphical, Create simulator written (e.g.) using pygame.

  * A turtle-to-Create compiler that will convert turtle programs to Create code. A turtle-to-Create compiler that will convert turtle programs to Create code. A turtle-to-Create compiler that will convert turtle programs to Create code.

  * An extension of the turtle package to handle Create-like commands, i.e. `create.forward_left(percent)` and `create.forward_right(percent)` and `create.forward(left = percent, right = percent)`, where `percent` is what what perctange of full-throttle the motor is run at.

Be sure to look at the code in [pyrobot project](http://code.google.com/p/pyrobot/).

Also, the [documentation for the Create Open Interface](http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=294) is on-line, and quite readable.

[casm](http://code.google.com/p/pycreate/source/browse/trunk/casm) is a simple assembler for writing Open Interface programs. It still needs some work, and, especially, some more testing.
