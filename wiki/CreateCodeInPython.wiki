We would like the following:

   * A simple, but graphical, Create simulator written (e.g.) using pygame.

   * A turtle-to-Create compiler that will convert turtle programs to Create code.

   * An extension of the turtle package to handle Create-like commands, i.e.
     `create.forward_left(percent)` and `create.forward_right(percent)` and
     `create.forward(left = percent, right = percent)`.

Be sure to look at the code in [http://code.google.com/p/pyrobot/ pyrobot project].
