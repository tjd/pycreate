We would like the following for the [http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=305 Create] robot:

   * A simple, but graphical, Create simulator written (e.g.) using pygame.

   * A turtle-to-Create compiler that will convert turtle programs to Create code. A turtle-to-Create compiler that will convert turtle programs to Create code. A turtle-to-Create compiler that will convert turtle programs to Create code.

   * An extension of the turtle package to handle Create-like commands, i.e. `create.forward_left(percent)` and `create.forward_right(percent)` and `create.forward(left = percent, right = percent)`, where `percent` is what what perctange of full-throttle the motor is run at.

Be sure to look at the code in [http://code.google.com/p/pyrobot/ pyrobot project].

Also, the [http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=294 documentation for the Create Open Interface] is on-line, and quite readable.

[casm http://code.google.com/p/pycreate/source/browse/trunk/casm] is a simple assembler for writing Open Interface programs. It still needs some work, and, especially, some more testing.
